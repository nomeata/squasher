Squasher
========

TL;DR: Squash your Github PRs with one click at <https://squasher.nomeata.de>!

Also, see the web page for user instructions.

The service, created by [Joachim Breitner], is a rather simple Python web app using the Github API, hosted on AWS Lambda using Zappa. Use at your own risk. Improvements welcome. I wish we did not need this.
